Enformation Redirect
====================

This is heavily inspired by [EZProxy Redirect Foxified](https://github.com/metronidazole/EZProxyRedirectFoxified)
so many thanks go to the original developers of that plugin.

Unfortunately, the [Enformation](https://www.e-nformation.ro) system used by
Romanian universities doesn't support EZProxy, so this extension builds an
equivalent redirecting system for it. This is mostly equivalent to writing it
yourself with more general add-ons such as [Redirector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirector/).
